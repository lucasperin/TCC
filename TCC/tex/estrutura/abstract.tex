Unauthorized changes of database content can result in significant losses for organizations and individuals making it is extremely important
to assure the privacy and integrity of databases. The \ac{DBMS} provides features to encrypt the database and
protect it against unauthorized access. However, open-source \ac{DBMS} do not provide means to protect the database against unauthorized modifications
and advanced \ac{DBMS} that do provide such features are too expensive for small business enterprises. In this paper, we analyse and implement a method to protect database systems against
unauthorized modifications. Furthermore we tested the analysed method, showing its efficiency.
