    abstract = {Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing users and organizations to exploit external services for the distribution of resources. A crucial problem to be addressed in this context concerns the enforcement of selective authorization policies and the support of policy updates in dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the enforcement of access control and the management of its evolution. Our proposal is based on the application of selective encryption as a means to enforce authorizations. Two layers of encryption are imposed on data: the inner layer is imposed by the owner for providing initial protection, the outer layer is imposed by the server to reflect policy modifications. The combination of the two layers provides an efficient and robust solution. The paper presents a model, an algorithm for the management of the two layers, and an analysis to identify and therefore counteract possible information exposure risks.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, users are more and more exploiting external storage and connectivity for sharing and disseminating user-generated content. To this aim, they can benefit of the services offered by Internet companies, which however assume that the service provider is entitled to access the resources. To overcome this limitation, we present an approach that does not require complete trust in the external service w.r.t. both resource content and authorization management, while at the same time allowing users to delegate to the provider the enforcement of the access control policy on their resources. Our solution relies on the translation of the access control policy into an equivalent encryption policy on resources and on a hierarchical key structure that limits both the number of keys to be maintained and the amount of encryption to be enforced.},

@article{Xie.integrity.2007,
    abstract = {An increasing number of enterprises outsource their IT services to third parties who can offer these services for a much lower cost due to economy of scale. Quality of service is a major concern in outsourcing. In particular, query integrity, which means that query results returned by the service provider are both correct and complete, must be assured. Previous work requires clients to manage data locally to audit the results sent back by the server, or database engine to be modified for generating authenticated results. In this paper, we introduce a novel integrity audit mechanism that eliminating these costly requirements. In our approach, we insert a small amount of records into an outsourced database so that the integrity of the system can be effectively audited by analyzing the inserted records in the query results. We study both randomized and deterministic approaches for generating the inserted records, as how these records are generated has significant implications for storage and performance. Furthermore, we show that our method is provable secure, which means it can withstand any attacks by an adversary whose computation power is bounded. Our analytical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

@article{Capitani2010,
    abstract = {Current access control models typically assume that resources are under the strict custody of a trusted party which monitors each access request to verify if it is compliant with the specified access control policy. There are many scenarios where this approach is becoming no longer adequate. Many clear trends in Web technology are creating a need for owners of sensitive information to manage access to it by legitimate users using the services of honest but curious third parties, that is, parties trusted with providing the required service but not authorized to read the actual data content. In this scenario, the data owner encrypts the data before outsourcing and stores them at the server. Only the data owner and users with knowledge of the key will be able to decrypt the data. Possible access authorizations are to be enforced by the owner. In this article, we address the problem of enforcing selective access on outsourced data without need of involving the owner in the access control process. The solution puts forward a novel approach that combines cryptography with authorizations, thus enforcing access control via selective encryption. The article presents a formal model for access control management and illustrates how an authorization policy can be translated into an equivalent encryption policy while minimizing the amount of keys and cryptographic tokens to be managed. The article also introduces a two-layer encryption approach that allows the data owner to outsource, besides the data, the complete management of the authorization policy itself, thus providing efficiency and scalability in dealing with policy updates. We also discuss experimental results showing that our approach is able to efficiently manage complex scenarios.},
