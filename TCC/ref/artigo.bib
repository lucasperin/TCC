    ABSTRACT="Unauthorized changes of database content can result in significant losses for organizations and individuals and it is extremely important the assurance of privacy and integrity of databases. The Database Management Systems (DBMS) provides features to encrypt the database and protect it against unauthorized access. However, open-source DBMSs does not provide means to protect the database against unauthorized modifications and advanced DBMSs that provides such features are too expensive. In this paper, we analyse and implement a method to protect database systems against unauthorized modifications. Furthermore we tested the analysed method, showing its efficiency.",
